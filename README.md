This project includes a simple **User Registration Form** built using HTML, styled with CSS, and enhanced with JavaScript for form validation. It validates the following:

- **Username** must be at least 3 characters long
- **Email** must contain `@` and `.`
- **Password** must be at least 8 characters long

It provides **real-time feedback** and uses **DOM manipulation** to dynamically interact with form elements.
